TV Show tracking application.

- Add form validation at Login and Signup, and handle errors from the server.
- Implement TTL on cookie.
- Create detail.html view and respective controller
- Create Subscribe factory to subscribe and unsubscribe from shows (create respective remote methods aswell)
- Use moment.js
- Set up global error alerts
- Fix 404 when user searches for non existing show.
- Fix querying shows (it should be more flexible, for example, searching "breaking" should return results with query ordered by relevance, only by clicking one should it be added to DB(?))
- After finishing views, start working on responsive layout.
- Create footer.
