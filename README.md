TV Show tracking application.

- Add form validation at Login and Signup, and handle errors from the server.
- Implement TTL on cookie.
- Create Subscribe factory to subscribe and unsubscribe from shows (create respective remote methods aswell)
- Set up global error alerts
- Create footer.
- Add wrapper for show info in show-detail.html
- Minify CSS and JS. Concat all JS into a single file. Create .maps (Maybe add to watch task?)
- Modify way of getting episodes. Maybe create Episode model and relate it to the Show model. Try server-side querying for the episodes, updating the model automatically and the angular client only has to retrieve it and display it.
- Implement some sort of "back button". (is it really necessary?)
