TV Show tracking application.

- Implement TTL on cookie.
- Set up global error alerts
- Create footer.
- Minify CSS and JS. Concat all JS into a single file. Create .maps (Maybe add to watch task?)
- create ng filter for truncating show.overview nicely
- validate signup form (confirm passwords) handle errors from server (wrong email, wrong password, etc)
- when user is forbidden and asked to login, create redirection to continue flow
- display all dates correctly, aswell as time left with moment.js
- create calendar for next episodes on subscribed shows
- update show information as necessary automatically
- implement caching of data (and time until it goes bad and requires update)
- implement notifications
- email validation (maybe?)
- sugar.js for dates aswell
- watchlist checkboxes need to update automatically, without the need for the submit button
- add loading spinner overlay on website
- don't show checkbox if episode hasn't aired yet
- style episode with no info
- "my shows" page needs to be made a lot better, with useful information but not messy
- search bar on home page should be detached from the panel
- show detail -> detach banner from panel, use space between to add the latest shows
- add more info to every page, make it all a bit more busy, it helps make the user feel like they have a lot more available to them

## SUGAR

- optimize red routes
- instant visual feedback on marking a show as watched
- **ERRORS** **ERRORS** SHOW ERRORS TO USER!
- show latest episodes in series detail page (maybe 3?)
- calendar for upcoming shows?
- main page should have a second panel for subscribed shows' latest episodes or upcoming or trending or top shows
- quick actions on show thumbnails?
