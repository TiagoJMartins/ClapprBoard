TV Show tracking application.

## TODO

- Create footer.
- Minify CSS and JS. Concat all JS into a single file. Create .maps (Maybe add to watch task?)
- create ng filter for truncating show.overview nicely
- when user is forbidden and asked to login, create redirection to continue flow
- create calendar for next episodes on subscribed shows
- update show information as necessary automatically
- implement caching of data (and time until it goes bad and requires update (redis?))
- don't show checkbox if episode hasn't aired yet
- style episode with no info
- search bar on home page should be detached from the panel

## SUGAR

- optimize red routes
- main page should have a second panel for subscribed shows' latest episodes or upcoming or trending or top shows
- quick actions on show thumbnails?
