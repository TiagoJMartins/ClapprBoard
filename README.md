TV Show tracking application.

- Add form validation at Login and Signup, and handle errors from the server.
- Implement TTL on cookie.
- Create Subscribe factory to subscribe and unsubscribe from shows (create respective remote methods aswell)
- Set up global error alerts
- Fix 404 when user searches for non existing show.
- Fix querying shows (it should be more flexible, for example, searching "breaking" should return results with query ordered by relevance, only by clicking one should it be added to DB(?))
- Center grid of shows in home page to eliminate white space on the right side.
- Create footer.
- Add wrapper for show info in show-detail.html
